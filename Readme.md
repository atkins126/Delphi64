This folder contains:

- SeaMM.dll lock-free scalable allocator
- SeaRTL.dll simd enabled rtl subset routines
- SeaZIP.dll accelerated zlib deflate compression
- RDPMM64.pas wrapper for memory manager (put this unit as first unit clause in project source)
- RDPSimd64.pas wrapper for simd rtl
- RDPZlib64.pas wrapper for zlib deflate
- RDPWebBroker64.pas utils to enhance webbroker web apps
- SeaIISFilter ultra-fast realtime deflate filter for IIS web server (5x faster than default gzip)
- License.txt for legal terms

A test with Indy, the built-in TCP Delphi library, on I7 cpu, shows an enhancement from 6934.29 ops/sec to 23097.68 ops/sec

Another test with WebBroker http compression, on I7 cpu, shows an enhancement from 147 pages/sec to 722 pages/sec

Another test with DMVC web api, on I9 cpu and windows 2016, simulating with apachebench 10000 requests and 100 users, shows an enhancement from 111 reqs/sec to 6448 reqs/sec

Another test, a ISAPI, on I9 cpu and windows 2016, doing in sequence DB query -> dataset of 1500 lines x 10 rows -> serialize to json string -> shrink it with deflate, is populating 2000 http reqs/sec, correctly filling all the cpu cores

If you want enable accelerated zlib programmatically into your WebBroker app, just add one line of code in afterdispatch event:

- procedure TWebModule.WebModuleAfterDispatch(Sender: TObject; Request: TWebRequest; Response: TWebResponse; var Handled: Boolean); 
- begin 
- Response.ZlibDeflate; 
- end;

The library is well tested, but if you found any trouble please notify me.

Thank you and best regards
